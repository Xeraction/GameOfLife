A little thing I made when I was bored.

Currently uses file-based input system. When you run it for the first time, it will generate a file with a grid of zeroes. These represent dead cells. Change them to ones to make alive cells. Then start the program and hit enter to start the simulation.

I will probably update this thing in the future, like making a better input system and other things.
